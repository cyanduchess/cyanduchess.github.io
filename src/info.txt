Hey there! I'm Chayanika Mitra, commonly known as Cyan. I reside in India. I am just an amiable teenager who possesses a lot of desires. 
<br /> I draw at times, and I also know some eye illusions, or you may also call it as magic. I like horse riding and spending time with my piano. And it's sweet melody is just elixer to my ears, ehich makes my day. I also like driving at break-neck speed.
<br /> This is just a website which is officially developed by my brother @riturajcodes - a web developer. I also do consist of a lot of enthusiasm and ... anyways it was lovely sharing with you.
